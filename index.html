  <h1>Trips through the American West, so far . . .</h1>
  
  <h2>Surreal and stunning geology</h2>
  
  <p>During my explorations from Montana to Arizona, I visited an array of great and diverse landscapes. Most of these were family
     roadtrips, and these photographs conjure the memories of brisk mornings and the first cup of coffee with my parents, glad we 
    had survived another night without encountering a bear on our way to the bathroom. </p>
